    "title": "Finally have a working Blog Site!",
    "body": "I am unbelievably excited about this.\r\n\r\nSo I've been working on this project for a while now and it's finally here! Or at least it's in good working condition in that I can finally write posts and publish them and they actually are stored in a database. The DB is local for now but it still feels good to make this work. I've done so much for this project including relearning so much of Node.js, EJS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, SASS, and Boostrap. I also researched a lot about handling JavaScript dates, which can get quite complicated especially when it comes to formatting (and also the weird indexing of months). Overall, this was quite a productive day, primarily thanks to GitHub projects! \r\n\r\nGitHub projects really changed my workflow quite a lot. I do a little bit of coding here and there whenever there's downtime at work, but usually, when a customer calls in, my coding focus gets broken and it's hard to get back into the groove once I'm done with the call. So instead, I opted to use these times to manage my GitHub project/s. For now, I just have one, which is for this particular project. In it, I built 2 views, one for my ideas, and one working as a Kanban board. I try to write the ideas/issues with as many details as possible to make sure that before I actually do the code, I don't end up second-guessing myself on what I'm doing and what I'm doing next and even why I'm doing what I'm doing in the first place. \r\n\r\nRight now, the task I'm doing is still the \"Setup DB w/ MongoDB + Mongoose\" task. I'm able to fetch the posts from the DB and also fetch a specific post based on date, and I'm also able to create new posts now. However, I still haven't built the functionality that allows me to edit and delete posts. That's what's coming tomorrow. I'm also going to do a major overhaul of the project structure, such as refactoring to reflect the dynamic EJS pages, Express routings, HTML and CSS hierarchy, and major JavaScript reworking (I intend to prioritize functional programming).\r\n\r\nOverall, I am so pumped for all the progress that I made today that I'm not even sure how I'm supposed to go to sleep with all this adrenaline. I have to, though, since I'm early for work tomorrow (uggh). I sincerely hope that this post will be the first of a never-ending stream of end-of-day thoughts from yours truly and that someday all these sacrifices will be worth it. LESGOOOO",
